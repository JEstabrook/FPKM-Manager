##FPKM-Manager

This python package aids in the interpretation of quantified transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences generated using high-throughput sequencing reads. This package interprets transcript abundances generated via Kallisto or Cufflinks and provides a suite of plotting utilities to explore and identify significant perturbations within a given RNA-Seq data set.
